## My first Library

### Summary
This library gets a path, checks if it is a path to a directory or a file. If it is a file, it returns the links within the file, with an option to check if the links are valid. If it is a directory, the library will repeat the operation until it reaches a file.

### Background
This lib was created in Alura's course "Node.js: Criando sua primeira biblioteca". 

In the course we worked with the possibility of a path being a file or a directory. But if within a directory there were another directory, it wouldn't work. I used recursivity to work around that.
